90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The typist has not typed the titles that have been
    added by the editor of the text in brackets (He has just typed the
    unbracketed titles written by the original author).But these titles are
    essential for the text. I inserted blank headers in their places (I
    didn’t add the titles because I’m not allowed to add anything to the
    text. I just showed their places in the text). 2- The page numbers must
    be reduced by one.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
