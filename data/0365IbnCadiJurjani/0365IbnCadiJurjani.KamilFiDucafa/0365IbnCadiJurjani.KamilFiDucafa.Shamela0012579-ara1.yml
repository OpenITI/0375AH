90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH, PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: PV introduced an additional level in the structural 
    tagging for the introduction and the main part of the book. 
    HRH tagged the name entries with ### $ and their subsections with # *; 
    PV replaced the name entries with ### |||| and their subsections with ### |||||. 
    HRH flagged a problem with pagination in volume eight, PV was not able to
    locate these problems. 
    HRH flagged a few redundant lines at the end of PageV06P045, PV removed them
    (as well as a number of lines at the beginning of the book, 
    on PageV01P002, which looked like random lines from the editorial introduction
    but not found on page 2 of the edition)
