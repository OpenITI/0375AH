90#AUTH#COMMENT##: Orosius' text was translated for the Umayyad caliph 
        al-Ḥakam II al-Mustanṣir (r. 350-366/961-976) in al-Andalus.
        Ibn Khaldun states that the text was translated for him by 
        "the judge of the Christians and their translator in Cordoba, Qāsim b. Aṣbagh";
        and elsewhere, "by two Muslims who used to translate for the caliphs in Cordoba".
        The editor of the text, ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Badawī, rejects Ibn Khaldun's statements
        about the translators of the text (see Badawī's introduction to the edition, p. 10-14).
        The text is extant in only one manuscript: New York, Columbia University Library, X 893-712 H.
