90#VERS#COMMENT##: The edition I have used for collation is exactly the same as the Shamela edition; however, I noticed a few changes. The Riwaya part is different in a few cases in Editpro text (see for instance the last line in page 115 of the PDF) and there seems to be some changes made by the editor/typist (like the first paragraph in page 102). 2- The page numbers at the top of the pages are interred into the text (and that is the correct pagination for the book; the automatic pagination is wrong). 3- There is an appendix at the end of the book (“الزيادة على تاريخ داريا”) which is added to the manuscript.
