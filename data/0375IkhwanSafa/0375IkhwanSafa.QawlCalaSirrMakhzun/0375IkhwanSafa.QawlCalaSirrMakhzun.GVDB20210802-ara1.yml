90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Manual transcription of MS Bibliothèque nationale de France
    Arabe 2309 folios 115b-122b, an early but highly variant attestation of material
    also found in 0375IkhwanSafa.RisalatJamicatJamica. Transcription is rough for
    OpenITI/passim purposes and contains several tentative readings of rather
    technical terminology, this should not be considered a definitive edition.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I added the REVIEW_NEEDED label. I think it’s better that the text is reviewed by a specialist bacause the OCR is incorrected as the annotator mentions and also for the technical terminology and maybe the authorship.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
