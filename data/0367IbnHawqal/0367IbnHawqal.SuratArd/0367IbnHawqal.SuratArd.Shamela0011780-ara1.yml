90#VERS#COMMENT##: 
        The Kramers edition contains three versions of the same text:
        * Kramers took as his main text Istanbul ms. 3346 (of which the folio
        numbers are in the text in square brackets)
        * De Goeje's earlier edition of the text (page numbers indicated
        in the margin of the printed edition with siglum  حط;
        not in the digital text). Passages from the de Goeje edition
        that are not in the Istanbul text are added between square brackets
        in Kramers' edition, and in the digital text.
        * the "Paris epitome" (BnF 2214), which contains a summary of the Istanbul text,
        with additions by a later contributor (most of these are explicitly dated,
        between the years 534-580/1129-1184). Passages from this manuscript
        that are not in the Istanbul text are added between square brackets
        and smaller script in Kramers' edition; in the digital text, they were
        only between square brackets, and thus indistinguishable from the
        additions from the de Goeje edition. PV put them between double
        square brackets.
        Kramers added after every image of the maps in the text a description
        of that map (see introduction, p. ه). PV extracted the images from
        the pdf and put them in the in the ./img folder, and added links to
        the images in the text using the standard markdown notation
        `![caption](image_link)`. Kramers' descriptions of the maps
        were extracted from the text and added to the ./img folder in separate
        text files (same file name as the image files, with extension `.caption`).
        PV removed the first-level headings for the two volumes of the edition,
        and the editorial introduction.
        PV also restored some missing references to the manuscript folios.
        PV tagged the manuscript's title page as paratext.
        PV put the numbered paragraphs at the beginning of a new line,
        and removed the hashes at the beginning of a new page if no new paragraph
        starts on the new page.
        PV typed up the last page of the book, which was missing from the digital text.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
