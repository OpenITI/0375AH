90#BOOK#COMMENT##: The text is a reworking of al-Iṣṭakhrī's
    Kitāb al-Masālik wa-al-Mamālik, which is almost entirely
    reproduced by Ibn Ḥawqal with mostly minor additions
    (except in the chapter on al-Maghrib, which is almost
    entirely new). At least three different versions of the
    text are extant:
    * Leiden and Berlin manuscripts: used as basis of de Goeje's edition
    * Istanbul manuscript: basis of Kramers' edition
    * "Paris epitome" (BnF 2214): contains a summary of the Istanbul text,
      with additions by a later contributor (most of these are explicitly dated,
      between the years 534-580/1129-1184)
    Traces of at least 2 different redactions of the text are known:
    * one dedicated to the Ḥamdānid Ṣayf al-Dawla (d. 356/967)
    * one dedicated to the unidentified Abū l-Sirrī al-Ḥasan b.
      al-Faḍl b. Abī l-Sirrī al-Aṣbahānī
    * (a third, later, redaction, has also been hypothesized)
