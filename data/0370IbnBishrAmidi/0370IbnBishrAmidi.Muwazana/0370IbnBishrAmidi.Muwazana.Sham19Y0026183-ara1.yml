90#VERS#COMMENT##: Text was pretagged and of good quality. Pagination appears to
    be fine. I tagged the poetry (though may have missed some half lines). I have
    deleted footnote markers. Textual hierarchy is not very evident from the
    headers, so I have divided according to the logic suggested in Julia Bray's
    article "Al-Amidi's al-Muwazana and the size of knowledge" (Journal of Abbasid
    Studies 2020), and where I could infer that a hierarchy was meant. Much of this
    is quite tentative, as it would require a close reading, and even then things
    are not very clear (see Bray's article). I have deleted some superfluous titles
    in volume 2, which are not in the pdf.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 963, 1800, 4306,
    4318, 6970, 7116, 7192, 7902, 8112, 8351, 8453, 8778, 8782, 9046, 9523, 9712,
    9770, 9811, 9828, 10330, 10513, 11099, 11202, 11213, 11436, 11761, 11762, 12519,
    12984, 13241, 13858, 14021, 19210

    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Changes in the headers and their levelling made
    (mostly based on the table of contents at the end of the volumes). 2- A few
    headers at the beginning of the text don’t exist in the PDF. They have been
    added to the text based on the table of contents at the end of the volumes. The
    problem was that they were at the beginning of the pages; while the beginning of
    the page was the continuation of the previous pages, and the header were
    actually for the second or third paragraph. So, I changed the place of such
    headers (based on what I understood from the text). The header for PageV01P259
    was at the beginning of PageV01P159. The header for PageV01P261 was at the
    beginning of PageV01P161. I moved them to their correct places.
