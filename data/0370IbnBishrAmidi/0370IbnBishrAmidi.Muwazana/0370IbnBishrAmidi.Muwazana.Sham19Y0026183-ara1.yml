90#VERS#COMMENT##: Text was pretagged and of good quality. Pagination appears to be fine. I tagged the poetry (though may have missed some half lines). I have deleted footnote markers. Textual hierarchy is not very evident from the headers, so I have divided according to the logic suggested in Julia Bray's article "Al-Amidi's al-Muwazana and the size of knowledge" (Journal of Abbasid Studies 2020), and where I could infer that a hierarchy was meant. Much of this is quite tentative, as it would require a close reading, and even then things are not very clear (see Bray's article). I have deleted some superfluous titles in volume 2, which are not in the pdf.
