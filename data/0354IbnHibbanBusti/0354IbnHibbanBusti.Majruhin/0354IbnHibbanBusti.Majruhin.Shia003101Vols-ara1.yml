90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The quality of the digital text is generally poor,
        and contains many typos. Sham19Y0151099 should become the primary version of the
        text.
        The JK and Shamela versions have automatic tags for
        names and are better for annotation; nevertheless the first 96 pages are
        missing in both of them and HRH had no choice but to annotate the Shia
        version that lacked any automatic tag. So HRH tagged all the names by
        hand.
        2- The edition HRH used for collation is exactly the edition
        that is used in the Shia version. So, the information of the PDF can be
        used to complete the information in the METADATA section (that is
        incomplete).
        3- Pages 273-276 are missing.
        4- The editorial section at the end of the book is the note of the scribe.
        5- Two other editions of the book can be found here:
        https://archive.org/details/waq44014 and
        https://www.almeshkat.net/book/13138.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
