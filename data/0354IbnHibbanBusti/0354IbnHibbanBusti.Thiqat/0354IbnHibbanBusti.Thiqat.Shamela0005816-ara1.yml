90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The table of contents for the first two volumes is
    a little tricky. The chronological order of the table of contents ends
    after 10 A.H. in the second volume. After that the table of content is
    organized according to the events in the lifetime of four successors of
    The Prophet. 2- I tried to use ### $$$$ for the parts that contain just
    a list of names (i.e. not a list of names + some explanations).
    3- Vol 6 Page 99 Line 9 is missing.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
