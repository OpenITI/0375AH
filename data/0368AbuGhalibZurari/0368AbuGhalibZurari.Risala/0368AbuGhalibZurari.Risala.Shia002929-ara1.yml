90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The link in VERS#LINKS leads you to a payment-
    based website and you must have an account to see the contents. This is
    a different edition that I have used for collation. 2- The text consists
    of two parts. The second part (that I have showed its beginning by a
    blank first-level header) is an index of books produced by the original
    author (there is no title in Editpro text to separate these two parts.
    In the edition I used for collation, this part is entitled “ثبت الكتب او
    فهرست الزراري” which can be inserted in front of my blank first-level
    header). 3- The first part of the text is a plain text without any
    titles (and the Shia version is the only version). The edition I used
    for collation is much better and has some titles that are very useful
    and gives a structure to the text. So, I showed the beginning of each
    chapter (in the PDF) by an asterisk in the text (i.e. # *) so that the
    beginning of each section is distinguishable and also these titles can
    be added later (I didn’t add the titles because I’m not allowed to add
    anything to the text. I just showed their places in the text). 4- The
    footnotes are interred into the text. The parts that appear after
    “<div>” (preceding a line) until the end of the page are footnotes and
    must be deleted. 5- These parts seem to be missing (However, I’m not
    sure, because I used a different edition for collation. So, it’s
    possible that this is a difference between the two editions): From the
    second line in Page 123 until the second line in page 125 of the PDF (=
    pages 14-15 of the text); First paragraph in page 151 of the PDF (= page
    41 of the text).
    PV removed the footnotes
