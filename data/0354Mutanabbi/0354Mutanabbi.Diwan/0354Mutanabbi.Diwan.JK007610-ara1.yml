90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The only thing that needs to be tagged in this
    Divan is the alphabetical letters that show the alphabetical order of
    the last letter of the rhyme-words (i.e. “حرف رويّ”), and I tagged them
    as first-level blank headers. 2- The Editpro edition cannot be found
    because there is no data in the METADATA section to show which edition
    it is. The edition I used for collation is the only edition I could find
    on the internet that has an alphabetical arrangement for the rhyme-words
    of the poems. Nevertheless, Editpro edition is much shorter than this
    edition (I don’t know why). 3- Two other editions and two manuscript of
    the text can be found here: https://archive.org/details/waq78396;
