90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: ASLISHO QURBONIEV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: This digital text is based on a version published in
    Iran in a Mirās-i ḥadīs-i Shīʿa series (ed. Mahdi Muhrizi, et al Qum:
    Dār al-Ḥadīth, 1382, vol. 10). The text is published with other texts in
    one volume, therefore it begind at page 35. There is a separate edition
    by Maktabat al-Aʿlamiyya, which is available in print and online (PDF).
    I have checked both versions. Footnotes indices are still present in the
    text. Paragraph marks are generally correct. ALSO, the last page (p.218)
    was missing from the Eshia digital edition, so I had to fetch it
    manually from another place and complete this version.
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Editorial removed. Changed levelling of the headers, and removed one tag for Juz’ which was not part of the structure.
