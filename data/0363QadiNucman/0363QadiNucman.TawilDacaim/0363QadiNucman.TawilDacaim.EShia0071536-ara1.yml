90#VERS#COMMENT##: Chapters 7 and 8 (entire  Volume 2) of this edition have been published repeatedly in the beginning
		of volume 3 (al-juzʾ al-thani). For this reason, I have cut volume 2, which consists of ch.7-8, entirely.
		Thus, the present texts is volume 1 and 3 and contains all the chapters of the work.
