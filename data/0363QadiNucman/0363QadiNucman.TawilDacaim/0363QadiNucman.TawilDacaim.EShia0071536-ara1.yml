90#VERS#COMMENT##: Chapters 7 and 8 (entire  Volume 2) of this edition
    have been published repeatedly in the beginning of volume 3 (al-juzʾ al-
    thani). For this reason, I have cut volume 2, which consists of ch.7-8,
    entirely. Thus, the present texts is volume 1 and 3 and contains all the
    chapters of the work.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Editorial removed.
