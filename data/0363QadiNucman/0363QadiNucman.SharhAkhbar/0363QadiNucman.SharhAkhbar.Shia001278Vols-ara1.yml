90#VERS#COMMENT##: The Shia version is the only version. So, I had to work on it despite it was a plain text without any automatic tags. The text has some problems: There are a lot of English characters in the text. Besides, some numbers are typed in Arabic instead of English. Moreover, at the beginning of some numbers, a tag like “NoteV02P013N” appears. I don’t know what it is. 2- The editorial parts at the end of the sections are the notes of the scribe (the ones in PageV01P415, PageV02P517, and PageV03P511 are the explanations of the editor on the contents of the Hadiths). 3- These titles must be added to the text in place of my blank headers: PageV03P085: “بقية فضائل أهل البيت”; PageV03P291 and PageV03P371: “بقية ذكر فضائل الأئمة من ولد الحسين بن علي عليه السلام”
