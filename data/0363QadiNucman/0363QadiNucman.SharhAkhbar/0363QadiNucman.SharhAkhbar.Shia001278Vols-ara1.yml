90#VERS#COMMENT##: The Shia version is the only version. So, I had to
    work on it despite it was a plain text without any automatic tags. The
    text has some problems: There are a lot of English characters in the
    text. Besides, some numbers are typed in Arabic instead of English.
    Moreover, at the beginning of some numbers, a tag like “NoteV02P013N”
    appears. I don’t know what it is. 2- The editorial parts at the end of
    the sections are the notes of the scribe (the ones in PageV01P415,
    PageV02P517, and PageV03P511 are the explanations of the editor on the
    contents of the Hadiths). 3- These titles must be added to the text in
    place of my blank headers: PageV03P085: “بقية فضائل أهل البيت”;
    PageV03P291 and PageV03P371: “بقية ذكر فضائل الأئمة من ولد الحسين بن علي
    عليه السلام”
